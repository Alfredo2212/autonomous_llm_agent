How Codex works
Today you can access Codex through the sidebar in ChatGPT and assign it new coding tasks by 
typing a prompt and clicking “Code”. If you want to ask Codex a question about your codebase, 
click “Ask”. Each task is processed independently in a separate, isolated environment 
preloaded with your codebase. Codex can read and edit files, as well as run commands including 
test harnesses, linters, and type checkers. Task completion typically takes between 1 and 30 
minutes, depending on complexity, and you can monitor Codex’s progress in real time.

Once Codex completes a task, it commits its changes in its environment. Codex provides 
verifiable evidence of its actions through citations of terminal logs and test outputs, 
allowing you to trace each step taken during task completion. You can then review the 
results, request further revisions, open a GitHub pull request, or directly integrate the 
changes into your local environment. In the product, you can configure the Codex environment 
to match your real development environment as closely as possible.

Codex can be guided by AGENTS.md files placed within your repository. These are text files, 
akin to README.md, where you can inform Codex how to navigate your codebase, which commands 
to run for testing, and how best to adhere to your project's standard practices. Like human 
developers, Codex agents perform best when provided with configured dev environments, reliable 
testing setups, and clear documentation.
