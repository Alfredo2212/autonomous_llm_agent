Introducing Codex
Today we’re launching a research preview of Codex: a cloud-based software engineering 
agent that can work on many tasks in parallel. Codex can perform tasks for you such as 
writing features, answering questions about your codebase, fixing bugs, and proposing pull 
requests for review; each task runs in its own cloud sandbox environment, preloaded with 
your repository.

Codex is powered by codex-1, a version of OpenAI o3 optimized for software engineering. 
It was trained using reinforcement learning on real-world coding tasks in a variety of 
environments to generate code that closely mirrors human style and PR preferences, adheres 
precisely to instructions, and can iteratively run tests until it receives a passing result. 
We’re starting to roll out Codex to ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team users today, with 
support for Plus and Edu coming soon.
