Toward agentic tool use
OpenAI o3 and o4-mini have full access to tools within ChatGPT, as well as your own custom 
tools via function calling in the API. These models are trained to reason about how to 
solve problems, choosing when and how to use tools to produce detailed and thoughtful 
answers in the right output formats quickly—typically in under a minute.

For example, a user might ask: “How will summer energy usage in California compare to 
last year?” The model can search the web for public utility data, write Python code to 
build a forecast, generate a graph or image, and explain the key factors behind the 
prediction, chaining together multiple tool calls. Reasoning allows the models to react 
and pivot as needed to information it encounters. For example, they can search the web 
multiple times with the help of search providers, look at results, and try new searches 
if they need more info.

This flexible, strategic approach allows the models to tackle tasks that require access 
to up-to-date information beyond the model’s built-in knowledge, extended reasoning, 
synthesis, and output generation across modalities.
