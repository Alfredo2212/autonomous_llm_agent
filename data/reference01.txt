Introducing Open AI 03 and 04 - MINI
Update on June 10, 2025: OpenAI o3‑pro is now available to Pro users in ChatGPT, 
as well as in our API. Like OpenAI o1‑pro, o3‑pro is a version of our most intelligent 
model, OpenAI o3, designed to think longer and provide the most reliable responses. 
Full details can be found in our release notes⁠(opens in a new window).

Today, we’re releasing OpenAI o3 and o4-mini, the latest in our o-series of models 
trained to think for longer before responding. These are the smartest models we’ve 
released to date, representing a step change in ChatGPT's capabilities for everyone 
from curious users to advanced researchers. For the first time, our reasoning models 
can agentically use and combine every tool within ChatGPT—this includes searching the 
web, analyzing uploaded files and other data with Python, reasoning deeply about visual 
inputs, and even generating images. Critically, these models are trained to reason about
when and how to use tools to produce detailed and thoughtful answers in the right output 
formats, typically in under a minute, to solve more complex problems. This allows them 
to tackle multi-faceted questions more effectively, a step toward a more agentic ChatGPT 
that can independently execute tasks on your behalf. The combined power of state-of-the-
art reasoning with full tool access translates into significantly stronger performance 
across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, setting a new standard in both 
intelligence and usefulness.
